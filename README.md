## 🧐 What is this?

Are you tired of organizing the office Secret Santa? Do you dread the moment when Uncle Bob draws his own name for the third time in a row, forcing everyone to fold their papers and start over?

**Fear not.** This application is here to save your holiday sanity.

It is a simple, client-side web application that pairs people up for gift exchanges faster than you can say "I hope I don't get a scented candle again."

## ✨ Features

*   **❄️ Immersive Atmosphere:** Features cutting-edge, CSS-based falling snow technology. It's the only white Christmas you're guaranteed to get this year.
*   **🛡️ Drama Prevention System (DPS):** The "Exclusions" feature allows you to ensure that *Person A* never draws *Person B*. Perfect for divorced couples, mortal enemies, or that one guy who gives everyone socks.
*   **🔗 No Database, No Cry:** It generates a unique link for every participant. Send it to them, and they will see a bouncing gift box. No login required.
*   **🎈 Confetti Explosion:** Because nothing says "You have to spend $20" like digital confetti.
*   **📱 Mobile Friendly:** Works on your phone, so you can organize this while hiding in the bathroom during Thanksgiving dinner.

## 🚀 How to Run

This project is built with the "Holy Trinity" of web development: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

1.  **Download** the `index.html` file.
2.  **Double click** it.
3.  **That's it.**

Seriously. There is no `npm install`, no Docker containers, no AWS configuration. It runs in your browser. It's eco-friendly code.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  **Add Participants:** Type names. Hit Enter. Repeat until all your friends/victims are listed.
2.  **Add Exclusions (Optional):** Select `Karen` ➔ `The Manager`. Now Karen cannot be The Manager's Secret Santa. HR will thank you.
3.  **Click "LOSUJ PARY" (Draw Pairs):** Watch the algorithm sweat as it tries to satisfy your complex social constraints.
4.  **Distribute:** Copy the generated links and send them via WhatsApp/Messenger/Carrier Pigeon.
5.  **Reveal:** The recipient clicks the link, opens the box, and finds out who they need to buy a gift for.

## ⚠️ A Note on "Security" (Read this, nerds)

This app uses **Base64 encoding** to hide the names in the URL parameters.

**Is this encryption?**
No.

**Can a hacker decode it?**
Yes. Easily.

**Can your Grandma decode it?**
Probably not.

**Should you use this to exchange nuclear launch codes?**
Please don't.

*This app is designed for fun, low-stakes gift exchanges. If you are buying a gift for the President, maybe use a different tool.*

## 💻 Tech Stack

*   **HTML5:** The skeleton.
*   **CSS3:** The makeup (Variables! Flexbox! Keyframe Animations!).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** The brain (now refactored to be cleaner than your kitchen before the guests arrive).
